# Containers
It has three classes that are in composition and aggregation relations. The classes will simulate a very simplified form of reservation management for a restaurant. The restaurant will manage a collection of reservations (composition); a messaging system will send confirmations for the reservation.

It demonstrates the ability to:
design and code composition and aggregation class relationships.
use member functions of the string class to parse a string into tokens based on simple rules.
design and code a class that manages a dynamically allocated array of pointers to objects
